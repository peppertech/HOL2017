### Prerequisites
* Node 4+ (preferably the LTS release)
* If running on a Mac, you will need to include "sudo" in front of all global npm commands shown in the lab
* Oracle JET CLI tooling installed globally.  Follow the README steps at the root of this repository for how to install.


>**NOTE**  
NPM v5 has known bugs that will cause the JET CLI tool to fail on installation. Make sure you are on an earlier version of NPM than 5.x
To check your NPM version, type: `npm --version`  


### Installation
Clone the project and run the following command from the root of the project folder:

```
npm install
ojet serve
```
The `ojet serve` command will build and run the application in your system default browser
